# BI Challenge

Dashboard 1: Executive Trip & Revenue Overview üìä
This dashboard should give me a high-level view of our operations at a glance. I need to see the big picture immediately.

Total Trips & Revenue: A chart showing the total number of trips and total revenue over time, broken down by day, week, and month. I want to see trends and seasonal fluctuations.

Average Trip Metrics: Key performance indicators (KPIs) showing the average trip distance, average fare amount, and average tip percentage. I need to see if these are increasing or decreasing over time.

Fleet Comparison: A side-by-side comparison of our yellow and green taxi fleets, showing the total trips, total revenue, and average trip length for each fleet.

Dashboard 2: Geographic & Demand Analysis üó∫Ô∏è
We need to understand where and when people are taking our taxis. This will help us with fleet deployment and marketing strategies.

Busiest Locations: A list of the top 10 pickup and dropoff locations by trip volume. I want to know which parts of the city are our primary hubs.

Peak Hours & Days: A heat map or chart that shows the number of trips by hour of the day and day of the week. This will help us identify our peak demand periods.

High-Revenue Routes: A report that shows the top 20 routes (from a specific PULocationID to a DOLocationID) with the highest total revenue. This could highlight profitable corridors.

Dashboard 3: Financial & Tipping Deep Dive üí∞
This dashboard should break down our revenue streams beyond the total amount. I need to understand where our money is coming from and how we can optimize our pricing and driver incentives.

Payment Type Breakdown: A pie chart showing the percentage of trips for each payment_type (e.g., credit card vs. cash). I also want to see the total revenue and tip amount generated by each payment type.

Tip Percentage by Trip: A distribution chart showing the frequency of different tip percentages. I want to see if most tips fall into a specific range.

Surcharge Impact: A detailed analysis of the total revenue generated from various surcharges, such as congestion_surcharge and Airport_fee, over time.


Final Challenge üôå
I want to see how quickly ClickHouse can process these requests on a multi-year dataset. Your final task is to create a report that ranks all the PULocationIDs by their total revenue generated, but only for trips that occurred on weekends and had a total_amount greater than $25. This will require some more complex filtering and aggregation across a large time span.
